# Goals
- Develop an anti-malware tool that can detect and remove malicious code from a system.
- Utilize ML algorithms, API usage, and Python libraries such as SciPy & NumPy to scan files and predict malicious activity.
- Create a prototype that can be used by corporations and individuals to contribute to the project.
- Create a unique and complete README.md file that explains the project and its features.

# Roadmap
- Develop the anti-malware tool using Python, ML algorithms, API usage, and Python libraries.
- Test the tool on various systems to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Create a prototype that can be used by corporations and individuals to contribute to the project.
- Create a unique and complete README.md file that explains the project and its features.
- Update the tool to run on the reader's own machine, with URLs and possible keys needing to be updated as well.
- Extend the project to become more powerful.

# Impressive Things
- Malicodex is an anti-malware tool that is built using Python, ML algorithms, API usage, and Python libraries such as SciPy & NumPy to scan files and predict malicious activity.
- It is designed to be used by corporations and individuals to contribute to the project.
- It is a prototype that can be easily built upon to become more powerful.

# Unique Features
- Malicodex utilizes ML algorithms, API usage, and Python libraries such as SciPy & NumPy to scan files and predict malicious activity.
- It is designed to be used by corporations and individuals to contribute to the project.
- It is a prototype that can be easily built upon to become more powerful.
- Any APIs used are closed source and a work in progress and likely will not be released to public due to licensing agreements, so someone should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs.
